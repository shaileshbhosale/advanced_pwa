   enabled domains

Installation
------------

1. Install 'Advanced Progressive web app' module
   - Install using composer: 'composer require drupal/advanced_pwa'
      (recommended)
      or
   - Download and install 'Advanced Progressive web app' module
   - The above mentioned 'web-push' library dependency will be automatically
      installed if you are installing the module using composer
2. If you did not install the module using composer, install the 'web-push'
    library manually:
   - Run 'composer require minishlink/web-push:^4.0' from your sites root
      folder
   Please note that the current module works only with web-push library
      version 4.0

Configuration
-------------

Once you install the module, a link 'Advanced pwa Settings' will appear on
   '/admin/config' page under 'System'.

1. Go to '/admin/config/system/advanced_pwa' to configure manifest related
     settings
   a. Enable 'Enable push notifications' to enable push notification feature.
       Disabling the push notifications will ensure that no user will be able
        to receive push notifications
   b. 'Short name' will be name of the app that will appear on users home
        screen
   c. Enter Name of the app
   d. 'General App Icon' will be the icon that will appear on users home
        screen, along with app name
   e. 'Background Color' will be shown when the user opens the website from
        their homescreen
   f. 'Theme Color' is used to create a consistent experience in the browser
2. Go to '/admin/config/advanced_pwa/config' to set up public / private keys
     and upload app notification icon
   Note: Click on 'Generate keys' before uploading notification icon.
3. 'Push Notification Subscription'
     ('/admin/config/advanced_pwa/config-subscription') config page will allow
        you to select content types. Push notification will be sent to
          subscribed users whenever content of the selected content type
           is published
4. 'Push Notification Subscription List'
     (/admin/config/advanced_pwa/subscription-list) page will show list of
       subscribed users
5. You can send generic notification message from
    'Broadcast Push Notification' (/admin/config/advanced_pwa/config-broadcast)
      page

Queue and Cron
--------------

Considering the fact that there could be hundreds of users subscribed to the
 site and multiple content editors either publishing content or sending
  generic notifications, our module will not send notifications as soon as
   content is published or generic message is sent. It will Queue the
    notifications and will be sent on next cron run.

You can either use Drupal core cron or any contributed cron modules like
 'Ultimate Cron'.

If you choose to use 'Ultimate Cron' module, you will have to enable
 'Override cron queue processing' checkbox under path
  '/admin/config/system/cron/settings'. This will expose queue workers as cron
   jobs and will show under '/admin/config/system/cron/jobs'.

Note: At the time of writing these instructions, this feature of 'Ultimate Cron'
 module was experimental. Enable it only if you need it.

Troubleshooting
---------------

1. The current module works only with web-push library version 4.0
2. Web-push library 4.0 needs php version 7.0 or higher

To Do
------

Currently no admin page is being cached, as admin pages are not needed to be
 shown offline. We have a future plan to implement a form, which will accept
  URLs to not get cached. This way user will be able to choose pages that need
   not be chached.

Use 'push_notification' as a service
------------------------------------

You can use 'push_notification' functionality as a service from any of your
  custom modules, if needed.
Name of the service is 'advanced_pwa.push_notifications'.

Usage example:
----------------------------------------------------
$sendNotificationService = \Drupal::service('advanced_pwa.push_notifications');

return $sendNotificationService::sendNotificationStart($subscriptionData,
  $notification_data);
----------------------------------------------------

'sendNotificationStart' is the method to which '$subscriptionData' and
  '$notification_data' arguments needs to be passed.

Check file 'AdvancedpwaQueueProcessor.php' for more details.
